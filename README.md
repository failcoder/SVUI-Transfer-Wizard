# SVUI-Transfer-Wizard
Tool to convert classic SVUI settings for use with the latest version

## INSTRUCTIONS:

First be sure that all of the following folders are DELETED from your AddOns directory:

* SVUI
* SVUI_ConfigOMatic
* SVUI_StyleOMatic
* SVUI_LogOMatic
* SVUI_FightOMatic
* SVUI_CraftOMatic
* SVUI_ChatOMatic

Next add THIS folder (also named "SVUI") to the AddOns directory.

After that you can then go to Curse or *WowInterface to download and install the latest version.
(*if new version is available, ie.. NOT the version with the word "Classic" in the title) 

Now simply be sure that all addons are enabled from the login screen and once you are in-game
the transfer wizard frame will appear and allow you to transfer your old files. 

## NOTES: 
* Keep in mind that this tool will ONLY RUN ONCE PER CHARACTER! 
* When you have completed the transfer on a character, you will not see the transfer tool again while on that character.
